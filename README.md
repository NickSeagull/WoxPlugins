# Wox Plugins

My own collection of plugins for the Windows launcher [Wox](http://www.wox.one/).

# How to install a plugin

You can install the plugins by downloading them from the [releases page](https://github.com/NickSeagull/WoxPlugins/releases) and drag-n-dropping into your Wox search bar.

Plugin for interacting with the text expander [Espanso](https://espanso.org/).

**Usage:**

* Activate with the keyword `espanso`
* Search for replacements by writing it directly after the keyword - e.g. `espanso thanks`
* Search for triggers by prefixing your search term with a `.` - e.g. `espanso .omw`
